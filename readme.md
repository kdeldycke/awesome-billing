Any company needs at one point to get money from customers. That's when things gets messy for us developers, as we try to reconcile the complexity of the business with our software stack.

This [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list helps software engineers **bootstrap billing & payments systems, and make sense of invoicing, pricing, accounting, marketplace, fraud and business intelligence**.

## Basics

<img align="right" width="50%" src="./assets/cloud-software-stack-billing.jpg"/>

In a Stanford class providing an [overview of cloud computing](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs349d/docs/L01_overview.pdf), the software architecture of the platform is described as in the right diagram ‚Üí

<!--lint disable double-link-->

Billing is one of the transversal pillar of the ecosystem, where customers, products and business meets. The [other pillar being Identity and Access Management (IAM) üë§](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-iam/).

<!--lint enable double-link-->

This highlight the strategic importance of the domain, not only for cloud providers but virtually any business, especially those who are software-centric.

- [Pricing, my only growth hack at Qonto](https://getlago.substack.com/p/pricing-my-only-growth-hack-at-qonto?s=r) - Most businesses don't know how to iterate over pricing: sales teams dictates them without involvement of the people in charge of implementation, which ends up in frustration for all. That's why you need to recognize billing as a critical function of your organization.

- [5 things I learned while developing a billing system](https://arnon.dk/5-things-i-learned-developing-billing-system/) - A great introduction on all the various aspects of a billing system, from currency to invoices, including great illustrations on the logic of changing plans. All these topics are detailed in dedicated sections below.

## Pricing

From monthly subscription to commodity-like on-the-go consumption, there's plenty of scheme out there to structure your product's pricing. Including the good old shopping-cart funnel.

- [Don't just roll the dice ‚Äì Software pricing guide](https://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf) - Huge and complete collection of pricing scheme, with their psychological effect and impact on revenue model.

### Usage-based Pricing

The dynamic scheme for elastic resources.

- [Why I Love Usage-Based Pricing](https://www.rdegges.com/2020/the-only-type-of-api-services-ill-use/) - ‚ÄúThe most important reason I like this pricing model is that it heavily incentivizes both the customer and the service provider to act in everyone's best interest.‚Äù Also details issues with other pricing models.

- [Use-cases for cloud services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19830022) - The reason usage-based pricing makes even more sense for cloud services: to optimize ROI, keep all regular workload in traditional architecture and reserve cloud computing for elastic and experimental projects.

- [Socially Optimal Pricing of Cloud Computing Resources](https://webee.technion.ac.il/people/shimkin/PAPERS/Menache-CloudPricing-Conf2011.pdf) - ‚ÄúThe socially optimal operating point is unique, and can be sustained by a linear, usage-based tariff, which charges a fixed price per unit resource and unit time.‚Äù This paper justify usage-based pricing for cloud resources.

- [A Survey of Profit Optimization Techniques for Cloud Providers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3376917) - ‚ÄúThe strategy of improving user service quality is discussed first, followed by the pricing strategy for cloud resources to maximize revenue.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúBilling is not complex on purpose: it's the price to pay for elasticity.‚Äù ([source](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1214160678363246592)) - Or why you're likely to get an endless stream of complaining users if choosing utility pricing scheme: while accurate to the (milli-)cent, this model is frustrating for customers not ready to invest time grasping the underlying concepts.

- [Electropedia: Tariffs for electricity](https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/index?openform&part=691) - Before the cloud, there was another metered resource priced by its usage: electricity.

- [Lago](https://github.com/getlago/lago) - Open-source metering & usage-based billing.

### Subscription Plans

Highly popular for SaaS businesses, subscription plans are easy to comprehend.

- [Pricing low-touch SaaS](https://stripe.com/en-in/atlas/guides/saas-pricing) - ‚ÄúIn low-touch SaaS, the most common way packages are presented are as different columns in a pricing grid, with each column corresponding to a plan, offered at a different price, with differential access to features or maximum allowable usage along some axis interesting to the business.‚Äù

## Product Catalog

The central repository of all available services, products, variants, options and pricing available to the customer to purchase. Catalogs for cloud services are most of the time tailor-made, but there is some classic PDM solutions ([Product Data Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_information_management), a.k.a. PIM for Product Information Management) out there that might fit the bill.

## Marketplace

A marketplace connect supply with demand that lead to a financial transaction. If there is no payment involved, then it is an aggregator, or a hub. Not a marketplace.

### Cloud Resources

This sub-section focus on bid/ask mechanism matching resource producer with consumers. Most of the time these are one-sided markets with the big platform trying to amortized under-utilized inventory.
